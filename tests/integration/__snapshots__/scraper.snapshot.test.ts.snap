It treats a range of infections caused by herpes viruses, including:

Your doctor may prescribe aciclovir to prevent you getting these infections if you've had them before or if you have a weak immune system.

It's also used to treat chickenpox and shingles.

Aciclovir is available on prescription. It comes as tablets, a liquid that you swallow, an eye ointment, a cold sore cream and a cream for genital herpes.

It's sometimes given by injection, but this is usually only done in hospital.

You can buy aciclovir cold sore cream at most pharmacies and shops without a prescription.",

If the infection gets worse at any time or the sore still has not healed after 10 days, speak to your doctor.
If your cold sore has not healed after 4 days, you can carry on using the cold sore cream for another 6 days.
If your cold sore still has not healed after this or it gets worse at any time, stop using the cream and speak to your doctor.

      "description": "Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). If you have high blood pressure, taking amlodipine can help to prevent future heart disease, heart attacks and strokes.

It is also used to prevent chest pain caused by heart disease (angina).

Amlodipine helps high blood pressure by relaxing and widening blood vessels. This lowers your blood pressure and makes it easier for your heart to pump blood around your body.

With angina, you usually get chest pain because the arteries going to the heart have become hardened and narrowed. Amlodipine helps by improving the blood and oxygen supply to your heart.

This medicine is only available on prescription. It comes as tablets or as a liquid you swallow.",

        {
          "answer": "Amlodipine is a type of medicine called a calcium channel blocker.
Like other calcium channel blockers, it relaxes and widens blood vessels. It does this by blocking calcium going into muscles in the heart and blood vessels. Muscles need calcium to contract, so when you block the calcium, it makes the muscle cells relax. This lowers your blood pressure and makes it easier for your heart to pump blood around your body.
In angina, amlodipine works by improving the blood and oxygen supply to your heart. Angina is chest pain that comes on when not enough blood gets to the muscles of the heart. This usually happens because the arteries going to the heart become hardened and narrowed.",
          "question": "How does amlodipine work?",
        },
        {
          "answer": "Amlodipine starts to work on the day you start taking it, but it may be a couple of weeks before it takes full effect.
If you're taking amlodipine for high blood pressure, you may not have any symptoms. In this case, you may not feel any different when you take amlodipine. This does not mean that the medicine is not working, so it's important to keep taking it.
If you're taking amlodipine for angina, it will probably take a couple of weeks before you feel better. Until then, you may still get chest pains sometimes, and you may even find the pain gets worse to start with.
If you get chest pain that does not stop after a few minutes or is new or worse than your chest pain caused by angina, this is a possible sign of a heart attack and needs to be checked out as soon as possible.
Make sure you have your medicine (spray or tablets) for treating angina attacks with you at all times and use it if you need to.",

          "answer": "There are several other calcium channel blockers which lower blood pressure in the same way as amlodipine.
They include nifedipine, felodipine, lacidipine and lercanidipine.
There are also 2 other calcium channel blockers, diltiazem and verapamil, that work slightly differently to lower blood pressure.
There are also lots of other types of medicines to lower your blood pressure. They work in a different way to calcium channel blockers. These include:
If you cannot take amlodipine or other calcium channel blockers because of side effects, you may be able to switch to another blood pressure-lowering medicine. Your doctor will advise which one is best for you depending on your age, ethnicity and medical history.
ACE inhibitors like ramipril and lisinopril
angiotensin receptor blockers like candesartan

        {
          "answer": "You can boost the health of your heart by making some key lifestyle changes.
These will also help if you have high blood pressure or angina:
Quit smoking – smoking increases your heart rate and blood pressure. Quitting smoking brings down your blood pressure and relieves heart failure symptoms. Try to avoid secondhand smoke, too.
Cut down on alcohol – drinking too much alcohol raises blood pressure over time. It makes heart failure worse, too.
Exercise – regular exercise lowers blood pressure by keeping your heart and blood vessels in good condition. It does not need to be too energetic, walking every day will help.
Eat well – aim to eat a diet that includes plenty of fruit and vegetables, wholegrains, fat-free or low-fat dairy products, and lean proteins. It's a good idea to follow these tips for a lower salt diet, too. Eating too much salt is the biggest cause of high blood pressure. The more salt you eat, the higher your blood pressure will be. Aim for no more than 6g of salt a day.
Deal with stress – when you're anxious or upset, your heart beats faster, you breathe more heavily, and your blood pressure often goes up. This can make heart failure worse, too. Find ways to reduce stress in your life. To give your heart a rest, try napping or putting your feet up when possible. Spend time with friends and family to be social and help keep stress at bay.
Vaccinations – if you have heart failure, it's recommended that you have the flu vaccine every year and the pneumococcal vaccine as recommended by your GP. Ask your doctor about these vaccinations. You can have them free on the NHS. COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for most people. Make sure you've had all the doses that you are eligible for. Talk to your doctor if you think you might be in one of the at risk groups.",

The addictive part of cigarette tobacco is called nicotine. Varenicline can reduce the cravings for nicotine and helps with the withdrawal you get when you stop smoking. These symptoms can include an urge to smoke again, feeling depressed or irritable, and difficulty sleeping.

Varenicline is only available on prescription and comes as tablets.",
